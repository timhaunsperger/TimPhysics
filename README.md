This is a physics engine designed to simulate the behavior of various object types and their interactions.  The simulation can be replayed after processing is complete so that complex simulations can be viewed in real time.

Currently Supports:
  Rigid bodies,
  Soft bodies,
  Particles,
  Static walls.
